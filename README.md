# frontend-boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chkal/frontend-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chkal/frontend-boilerplate)

Boilerplate for Java projects that want to use modern JavaScipt tooling.

The sample project demonstrates how to combine the following technologies

  * **Maven**: The standard build system for Java projects
  * **Webpack**: The bundler for javascript and friends
  * **Babel**: Babel compiler for writing next generation JavaScript
  * **TypeScript**: The typed superset of JavaScript
  * **Handlebars**: Simple and powerful templates for JavaScript
  * **Karma**: The spectacular Test Runner for JavaScript

Please note that this project doesn't just show how to integrate those technologies.
The most important goal was to create a great development experience.
